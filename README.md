# BookingSystem

## Description 

The University needs help to develop a booking system.
The booking system will be used in order to schedule bookings for people who want  to stop the spread of COVID-19 by getting tested.

## Prerequisites

JAVA 8.0

## Date

Project was finished on 28/02/2021.

## Setup

Unzip the archive. 
Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (BookingApp.java). 
Assume it's C:.
Type 'javac BookingApp.java' and press enter to compile your code. 
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set).
Now, type ' java BookingApp ' to run your program. 
You will be able to see the result printed on the window.

## Usage

This program is useful when it comes to the current situation of Covid-19.
People are getting tested on a daily basis. 
That is why we need a program to keep the evidence of who is getting tested, how many tests are being done daily.
This kind of information is important to universities and to the government.
You are able to make appointments for people by matching the available space and the available staff.
Everyone can become a staff member and everyone can get tested if they want to.
